    <p>
The principles behind hypothesis driven development are very simple and can be summed up as follows:

1) Measure everything and make everything measurable and observable.

2) Use what you measure to tell you what to do next and resist guessing. Don't build things that have no real measurable customer value.

Experienced software professionals know that when building software, there is often a lot of guess work involved in determining and aligning with the customers actual needs. This invariably leads to the presence of features that are not needed, and this at great expense. When it comes to software, it can be fiendishly difficult to build the right thing.

In order to reduce the guesswork and align more closely with what the customer really needs, a more empirical approach is needed.

What if software planning, construction and deployment mechanisms could be augmented with an approach that makes it easy to define, measure, collect and interpret relevant metrics. This collected information could then be used to inform and determine what should be done in subsequent iterations. The result would be measureably improved customer value ... the stuff that people are much more likely to want, use and pay for.

Hypothesis driven development is about trying to make it easy to implement this difficult but extremely valuable approach to building software
